//Why did you choose to build this project?

My choice in wanting to buiild a social media platform came from other popular ones such Facebook or Reddit. This particular project was actually
based on a personal favorite, called Medium.

I felt constructing an entire social media platform would provide me an incredible
amount of experience with the backend layer, database layer, and how everything would subsequently connect to the frontend. The entire "web development pie", if you will.

// What challenged you when making this project?

I was introduced to many new concepts for this project that provided new challenges. The following list is a short summary:

(1) CORS policy (a big one)
(2) Promises
(3) Maintaining aspect ratio for images
(4) Adding "fade in" functionality to certain components
(5) accessing data passed from the url

// What did you learn from making this project?

I learned quite a bit in stride with everything from the challenges above.

The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error was probably the biggest hurdle. As a new
developer, getting my head wrapped around the idea of what 3rd party URLs (origins) are in the context of resource sharing, what types of requests can be allowed, and how the server must be configured in order to allow such requests.

Being able to implement multiple promises was also difficult. Knowing
tools like Promise.all()

//What learnings have you taken with you into other projects?

//What would you do differently next time?

//Did you get stuck at any point? How did you get unstuck?

//What was your process for completing this project? Did you do wireframes, make a Trello board, or did you just get stuck into it?
